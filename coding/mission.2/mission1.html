    <p>The Monk diamond was found by a dog, who was this dog you may ask, well this dog is only Professor Bairstone's dog. <br/>
        The jewel was discovered by the dog in a Siberia cave. <br/>Not much is known about what happened to the jem after being stolen back in 2019 but there are theories that<br/>
        the gem was stolen by a crime mob, experts in the stealing of gems.</p>
    <div>
        <p>Here is the team minus the dog who should be getting all the credit:</p>

    <p>The other person in the image is Dr. Day who is Professor Bairstone's assent when Professor Bairstone's in Siberia. <br/>When the team saw the dog barking at something
        the team went to see what was so important that that dog needed to bark instead of talking.<br/>then they saw it, a 300 caret behemoth of a gem.</p>

    <p>After months of emailing me, Professor Bairstone finally convinced me to make him a website talking about 'his achievement'.<br/> There is not anything else I could talk about
        but, I do have an interview that happened.</p>
